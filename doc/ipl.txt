(no, don't copy this file into the CD as IPL.TXT, it'll kill you.)

IPL.TXT is an important file for Neo-Geo CD games, as it contains the list of
initial files to load.

[File List]
"There must not be more than 32 files to load."

from https://wiki.neogeodev.org/index.php?title=Game_CD_structure
"It seems that the NeoGeo CD wants at least a PRG, FIX, SPR, Z80 and PCM
loaded in IPL.TXT, or else it will simply reset after loading."

The FIX file is often the first one defined. This is not a hard requirement.

Each line:
Filename,Bank,Offset

newlines are CR+LF

So far, all known IPL.TXT files end with an 0x1A byte.

Last Blade 2's IPL.TXT has filenames in lowercase; most games use uppercase.
Not sure if this makes a difference or not.

The simplest possible IPL.TXT (replacing '*' with proper filenames) consists of:
*.FIX,0,0
*.SPR,0,0
*.Z80,0,0
*.PCM,0,0
*.PRG,0,0
