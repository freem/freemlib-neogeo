freemlib for Neo-Geo - Palette Actions
======================================
Palette actions are in charge of handling effects for sections of the palette.
This is different from full-palette effects (e.g. fading).

"(You really should just load a pre baked palette entry instead of computing it)"

(Usage)
Trying to figure out the best way to handle this...
palAction_Handler runs through the Palette Action buffer every frame.

The Palette Action buffer will need to be updated in order for this to work, and
persistent data will need to exist for some effects (e.g. how many frames a
certain effect has run).

(Command List)
$FF    Stop All Actions
$00    No Action
$01    Palette Index Cycling
$02    Color Animation
$03    Color Pulse
$04    Color Ramp

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
($FF) Stop Actions
  Stops all actions.

($00) No Action
  Does nothing.

($01) Palette Index Cycling (palsetNum, startIdx, numColors, frameTime, animTime)
  Create a color cycling effect.
  * palsetNum       [byte] Palette set number (0-255/$00-$FF)
  * startIdx        [byte] Starting index (1-15/$1-$F)
  * numColors       [byte] Number of colors in cycle (2-15)
  * frameTime       [????] Frames before switching colors
  * animTime        [????] Time to loop palette cycling. (0=loop forever?)

($02) Color Animation (palsetNum, startIdx, colorAnimPtr)
  Play back a set of colors, similar to an animation.
  * palsetNum       [byte] Palette set number (0-255/$00-$FF)
  * startIdx        [byte] Starting index (1-15/$1-$F)
  * colorAnimPtr    [long] Color animation data pointer

($03) Color Pulse
  (0->1->0; repeat)

($04) Color Ramping
  (0->1, then flatlines to 0; repeat)
