freemlib for Neo-Geo - Sound Driver
===================================
This will easily take up a lot of time because I have no fucking idea what I'm
doing, and the public documentation for writing a Neo-Geo sound driver from
scratch is pretty sparse (and focused on ADPCM, since FM is hard and nearly no
one wants to use the SSG for music). On top of that, I've recently learned that
the MVSTracker driver doesn't work on original hardware:

"For the 'homebrew' scene, we had a very basic sound driver that Ivan (MVS Tracker)
and myself worked on many years ago. Ivan did a very good job of implementing
FM music but the driver didn’t work on real hardware."

However, after looking at smkdan's M1 driver, it seems this is an easily fixable
problem that just needs some testing.

This document is a work in progress! Everything is subject to change!

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Most of this seems like it'd be on the Z80 end, but I still have to define some
codes for 68K<->Z80 comms.

SNK drivers consider the following codes to be used for audio data:
* $20-$5F	Music (64 songs; $5F reserved for eyecatch)
* $60-$FF	Sound (160 sounds; $7F reserved for coin sound)
 * $60-$7F	SSG effects (32 sounds)
 * $80-$BF	ADPCM-B samples (64 sounds)
 * $C0-$FF	ADPCM-A samples (64 sounds)

<SNK System Commands>
This list isn't 100% finalized yet, as I need to figure out what the SNK drivers
actually do with various commands.
(Also, what version of the music driver does this match up with?)

Commands marked with a * are used by the BIOS.

<freemlib System Commands>
The data that was here is now in sound/soundCommands.txt.

================================================================================
<Functionality>
The sound driver's total functionality depends on the hardware.

Z80 I/O ports:
$00			(read) Sound Code input (Communication from 68K to Z80)
$00			(write) Clear Sound Code input
$04			(read) [YM] Status 0 (Busy, Timer A and B flags)
$05			(read) [YM] SSG registers
$06			(read) [YM] Status 1 (ADPCM flags for samples reaching end address)
$08			(write) Enable NMI
$0C			(write) Sound Code output (Communication from Z80 to 68K)
$18			(write) Disable NMI
$C0			(write) ???

Banking is also done via the I/O ports, see "Z80 Banking" section below.

(CD-specific?)
$80			(write) ???
$C1			(write) ???
$C2			(write) ???

The YM2610 gives us:
* Timers	(2 timers, A and B)
* SSG		(3 channels)
* FM		(4 channels)
* ADPCM-A	(6 channels, 18.5kHz sampling rate)
------------------------------------------------------
* ADPCM-B	(1 channel, 1.8kHz~55.5kHz sampling rate); cart systems only
* CDDA		(CD audio, 44.1kHz sampling rate); CD systems only

Driver Stuff

* Current Command
* Previous Command
* Command buffer (How many bytes?)

* Channel Enable/Disable Flags

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Song Attributes/Playback
* Current Song number
* Current Song Tempo (0-511)
* Channel Use flags (2 bytes)

* Song loop flag?
* Song loop point pointer? (shared between channels)
* Song playback timer?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Hardware Stuff

[Timers]
4 bytes:
 * 1 byte for Timer A 9-2 ($24)
 * 1 byte for Timer A 1-0 ($25)
 * 1 byte for Timer B ($26)
 * 1 byte for Timer Control and 2CH Mode ($27)

2CH Mode Settings:
00		Normal				Normal output
01		CSM					CSM voice synth; each slot can have its own frequency.
							Key on/off is done with timer A.
10		Effect sound		Separate frequency number and CSM can be set in each slot.
11		Illegal?

CSM = Composite Sinusoidal Modeling
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formant

[SSG]
Looks like 14 bytes based on the following:

Overall Status>
	* 1 byte for value at $07 (Channels A,B,C,Noise)
	* 2 bytes for volume envelope period tuning
	* 1 byte for volume envelope shape ($0D)
If you wanted to be clever, you could combine $07 and $0D...

Pulse (x3)>
 * 2 bytes for tune
 * 1 byte for Mode/Volume

Noise>
 * 1 byte for noise period.

[ADPCM-A]
There are 6 channels of ADPCM-A audio, so if it looks small, rest assured that
it will take up a lot of space. 32 bytes in total, actually.

Overall Status>
 * 1 byte for Dump and Channel Toggle ($00)
 * 1 byte for Master Volume ($01)

Per-Channel>
 * 1 byte for L/R and Channel Volume ($08-$0D)
 * 2 bytes for sample start address ($10-15, $18-$1D)
 * 2 bytes for sample end address ($20-25, $28-$2D)

[ADPCM-B]
Since only one sample can play at a time, we don't need nearly as much space.

9 bytes maybe? Could possibly be 8 if combining $10 and $11.

Overall Status>
 * 1 byte for Start/Repeat/Reset? ($10)
 * 1 byte for L/R ($11)
 * 2 bytes for sample start address ($12,$13)
 * 2 bytes for sample end address ($14,$15)
 * 2 bytes for sample playback rate ($19,$1A)
 * 1 byte for channel volume ($1B)

ADPCM-B Sampling Rate>
	[(Delta-N(H) + Delta-N(L)) / 256] x 55.5 KHz
Examples:
 * Delta-N (H) = 85 (0x55), Delta-N (L) = 33 (0x21); Frequency = 18,050 KHz
  * [(85 + 33) / 256] = 0.4609375; x55.5 = 25.58203125
 * Delta-N (H) = 101 (0x65), Delta-N (L) = 71 (0x47); Frequency = 22,050 KHz
 * Delta-N (H) = 203 (0xCB), Delta-N (L) = 42 (0x2A); Frequency = 44,100 KHz
  * 0xC2BA??

[FM]
This part is going to take up the most space because FM synthesis is the result
of a lot of fuckin' values and shit. Multiply that by 4 channels.

Overall Status>
 * 1 byte for LFO, Freq. Control ($22)
 * 1 byte for Key On/Off ($28)

Frequency Control (0-7): 3.98, 5.56, 6.02, 6.37, 6.88, 9.63, 48.1, 72.2 Hz

Per-Channel>
 * 2 bytes for Frequency
 * 1 byte for Feedback/Connection (algorithm)
 * 1 byte for L/R, AMS, PMS

"The frequency is a 14-bit number that should be set high byte, low byte 
(e.g. ports $A4 then $A0). The highest 3 bits, called the "block", give the octave.
The next 10 bits give the position in the octave."

Write Block+High 3 first, then the Low 8

"Feedback is the degree to which operator 1 feeds back into itself"
Feedback: 0, pi/16, pi/8, pi/4, pi/2, pi, 2pi, 4pi

AMS (0-3): 0, 1.44, 5.9, 11.8 dB
PMS (0-7): 0, 3.4, 6.7, 10, 14, 20, 40, 80

Per-Operator>
 * 1 byte Detune, Multiple
 * 1 byte Total Level
 * 1 byte Key Scale/Attack Rate
 * 1 byte AM ON/Decay Rate
 * 1 byte Systain Rate
 * 1 byte Sustain Level/Release Rate
 * 1 byte SSG-type Envelope Control
