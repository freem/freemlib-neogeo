"I would normally give bytes as hex values, but it is easier to understand a consistent notation."

Effects:
Effects are written as groups of 4 bits, eg. 1871 = 7 * 256 + 4 * 16 +
15 = [7][4][15]. The high nibble (4 bits) usually determines the effect,
but if it is [14], then the second nibble is used as well.

[0]: Arpeggio
     Where [0][x][y] means "play note, note+x semitones, note+y
     semitones, then return to original note". The fluctuations are
     carried out evenly spaced in one pattern division. They are usually
     used to simulate chords, but this doesn't work too well. They are
     also used to produce heavy vibrato. A major chord is when x=4, y=7.
     A minor chord is when x=3, y=7.

[1]: Slide up
     Where [1][x][y] means "smoothly decrease the period of current
     sample by x*16+y after each tick in the division". The
     ticks/division are set with the 'set speed' effect (see below). If
     the period of the note being played is z, then the final period
     will be z - (x*16 + y)*(ticks - 1). As the slide rate depends on
     the speed, changing the speed will change the slide. You cannot
     slide beyond the note B3 (period 113).

[2]: Slide down
     Where [2][x][y] means "smoothly increase the period of current
     sample by x*16+y after each tick in the division". Similar to [1],
     but lowers the pitch. You cannot slide beyond the note C1 (period
     856).

[3]: Slide to note
     Where [3][x][y] means "smoothly change the period of current sample
     by x*16+y after each tick in the division, never sliding beyond
     current period". Any note in this channel's division is not played,
     but changes the "remembered" note - it can be thought of as a
     parameter to this effect. Sliding to a note is similar to effects
     [1] and [2], but the slide will not go beyond the given period, and
     the direction is implied by that period. If x and y are both 0,
     then the old slide will continue.

[4]: Vibrato
     Where [4][x][y] means "oscillate the sample pitch using a
     particular waveform with amplitude y/16 semitones, such that (x *
     ticks)/64 cycles occur in the division". The waveform is set using
     effect [14][4]. By placing vibrato effects on consecutive
     divisions, the vibrato effect can be maintained. If either x or y
     are 0, then the old vibrato values will be used.

[5]: Continue 'Slide to note', but also do Volume slide
     Where [5][x][y] means "either slide the volume up x*(ticks - 1) or
     slide the volume down y*(ticks - 1), at the same time as continuing
     the last 'Slide to note'". It is illegal for both x and y to be
     non-zero. You cannot slide outside the volume range 0..64. The
     period-length in this channel's division is a parameter to this
     effect, and hence is not played.

[6]: Continue 'Vibrato', but also do Volume slide
     Where [6][x][y] means "either slide the volume up x*(ticks - 1) or
     slide the volume down y*(ticks - 1), at the same time as continuing
     the last 'Vibrato'". It is illegal for both x and y to be non-zero.
     You cannot slide outside the volume range 0..64.

[7]: Tremolo
     Where [7][x][y] means "oscillate the sample volume using a
     particular waveform with amplitude y*(ticks - 1), such that (x *
     ticks)/64 cycles occur in the division". If either x or y are 0,
     then the old tremolo values will be used. The waveform is set using
     effect [14][7]. Similar to [4].

[8]: (Set panning position)
     This command is unused by the vast majority of trackers, but one
     tracker for the PC (called DMP) uses this for setting the panning
     state of the channel. As this is very useful, I am documenting it
     here. The effect [8][x][y] means "set channel to panning position
     x*16 + y". Position 0 is left, 64 is centre, 128 is right.
     Interestingly, position 164 is defined as "surround". 

[9]: Set sample offset
     Where [9][x][y] means "play the sample from offset x*4096 + y*256".
     The offset is measured in words. If no sample is given, yet one is
     still playing on this channel, it should be retriggered to the new
     offset using the current volume.

[10]: Volume slide
     Where [10][x][y] means "either slide the volume up x*(ticks - 1) or
     slide the volume down y*(ticks - 1)". If both x and y are non-zero,
     then the y value is ignored (assumed to be 0). You cannot slide
     outside the volume range 0..64.

[11]: Position Jump
     Where [11][x][y] means "stop the pattern after this division, and
     continue the song at song-position x*16+y". This shifts the
     'pattern-cursor' in the pattern table (see above). Legal values for
     x*16+y are from 0 to 127.

[12]: Set volume
     Where [12][x][y] means "set current sample's volume to x*16+y".
     Legal volumes are 0..64.

[13]: Pattern Break
     Where [13][x][y] means "stop the pattern after this division, and
     continue the song at the next pattern at division x*10+y" (the 10
     is not a typo). Legal divisions are from 0 to 63.

[14][0]: Set filter on/off
     Where [14][0][x] means "set sound filter ON if x is 0, and OFF is x
     is 1". This is a hardware command for some Amigas, so if you don't
     understand it, it is better not to use it.

[14][1]: Fineslide up
     Where [14][1][x] means "decrement the period of the current sample
     by x". The incrementing takes place at the beginning of the
     division, and hence there is no actual sliding. This type of
     sliding cannot be continued with effect [5]. You cannot slide
     beyond the note B3 (period 113).

[14][2]: Fineslide down
     Where [14][2][x] means "increment the period of the current sample
     by x". Similar to [14][1] but shifts the pitch down. You cannot
     slide beyond the note C1 (period 856).

[14][3]: Set glissando on/off
     Where [14][3][x] means "set glissando ON if x is 1, OFF if x is 0".
     Used in conjunction with [3] ('Slide to note'). If glissando is on,
     then 'Slide to note' will slide in semitones, otherwise will
     perform the default smooth slide.

[14][4]: Set vibrato waveform
     Where [14][4][x] means "set the waveform of succeeding 'vibrato'
     effects to wave #x". [4] is the 'vibrato' effect.  Possible values
     for x are:
          0 - sine (default)      /\    /\     (2 cycles shown)
          4  (without retrigger)     \/    \/

          1 - ramp down          | \   | \
          5  (without retrigger)     \ |   \ |

          2 - square             ,--,  ,--,
          6  (without retrigger)    '--'  '--'

          3 - random: a random choice of one of the above.
          7  (without retrigger)
     If the waveform is selected "without retrigger", then it will not
     be retriggered from the beginning at the start of each new note.

[14][5]: Set finetune value
     Where [14][5][x] means "sets the finetune value of the current
     sample to the signed nibble x". x has legal values of 0..15,
     corresponding to signed nibbles 0..7,-8..-1 (see start of text for
     more info on finetune values).

[14][6]: Loop pattern
     Where [14][6][x] means "set the start of a loop to this division if
     x is 0, otherwise after this division, jump back to the start of a
     loop and play it another x times before continuing". If the start
     of the loop was not set, it will default to the start of the
     current pattern. Hence 'loop pattern' cannot be performed across
     multiple patterns. Note that loops do not support nesting, and you
     may generate an infinite loop if you try to nest 'loop pattern's.

[14][7]: Set tremolo waveform
     Where [14][7][x] means "set the waveform of succeeding 'tremolo'
     effects to wave #x". Similar to [14][4], but alters effect [7] -
     the 'tremolo' effect.

[14][8]: -- Unused --

[14][9]: Retrigger sample
     Where [14][9][x] means "trigger current sample every x ticks in
     this division". If x is 0, then no retriggering is done (acts as if
     no effect was chosen), otherwise the retriggering begins on the
     first tick and then x ticks after that, etc.

[14][10]: Fine volume slide up
     Where [14][10][x] means "increment the volume of the current sample
     by x". The incrementing takes place at the beginning of the
     division, and hence there is no sliding. You cannot slide beyond
     volume 64.

[14][11]: Fine volume slide down
     Where [14][11][x] means "decrement the volume of the current sample
     by x". Similar to [14][10] but lowers volume. You cannot slide
     beyond volume 0.

[14][12]: Cut sample
     Where [14][12][x] means "after the current sample has been played
     for x ticks in this division, its volume will be set to 0". This
     implies that if x is 0, then you will not hear any of the sample.
     If you wish to insert "silence" in a pattern, it is better to use a
     "silence"-sample (see above) due to the lack of proper support for
     this effect.

[14][13]: Delay sample
     Where [14][13][x] means "do not start this division's sample for
     the first x ticks in this division, play the sample after this".
     This implies that if x is 0, then you will hear no delay, but
     actually there will be a VERY small delay. Note that this effect
     only influences a sample if it was started in this division.

[14][14]: Delay pattern
     Where [14][14][x] means "after this division there will be a delay
     equivalent to the time taken to play x divisions after which the
     pattern will be resumed". The delay only relates to the
     interpreting of new divisions, and all effects and previous notes
     continue during delay.

[14][15]: Invert loop
     Where [14][15][x] means "if x is greater than 0, then play the
     current sample's loop upside down at speed x". Each byte in the
     sample's loop will have its sign changed (negated). It will only
     work if the sample's loop (defined previously) is not too big. The
     speed is based on an internal table.

[15]: Set speed
     Where [15][x][y] means "set speed to x*16+y". Though it is nowhere
     near that simple. Let z = x*16+y. Depending on what values z takes,
     different units of speed are set, there being two: ticks/division
     and beats/minute (though this one is only a label and not strictly
     true). If z=0, then what should technically happen is that the
     module stops, but in practice it is treated as if z=1, because
     there is already a method for stopping the module (running out of
     patterns). If z<=32, then it means "set ticks/division to z"
     otherwise it means "set beats/minute to z" (convention says that
     this should read "If z<32.." but there are some composers out there
     that defy conventions). Default values are 6 ticks/division, and
     125 beats/minute (4 divisions = 1 beat). The beats/minute tag is
     only meaningful for 6 ticks/division. To get a more accurate view
     of how things work, use the following formula:
                             24 * beats/minute
          divisions/minute = -----------------
                              ticks/division
     Hence divisions/minute range from 24.75 to 6120, eg. to get a value
     of 2000 divisions/minute use 3 ticks/division and 250 beats/minute.
     If multiple "set speed" effects are performed in a single division,
     the ones on higher-numbered channels take precedence over the ones
     on lower-numbered channels. This effect has a large number of
     different implementations, but the one described here has the
     widest usage.
